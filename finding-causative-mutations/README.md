This is a lesson on Mutational Genomics prepared for a 2.5 h workshop at the [Galaxy Community Conference 2015](http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk), held at [The Sainsbury Laboratory](http://tsl.ac.uk) in Norwich, UK. 

The lesson is based on [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) templates and training ideas, though it is not (yet?) an 'official' Software Carpentry lesson.
