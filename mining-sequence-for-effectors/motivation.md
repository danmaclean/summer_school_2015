title: Finding Effector Genes and Proteins
subtitle: What is an effector protein?

## Why find effectors?

Briefly, they're the pathogen's arsenal.

So if we can work out what they are we're going to have a great start on working out the biology behind all sorts of aspects of infection and disease.

## Could anything be an effector?

The definition of what an `effector` is is pretty poor, so basically yes - anything could be an effector. But don't be put off, we can still start to make lists of genes and proteins that are candidates. In practice it means that we have to be intelligent in what we consider to be an effector.  

> ## Definitions in Biology {.callout}
> The poor definition of effector is one example of a common phenomenon in biology - badly worked out definitions. This occurs as a consequence of the messiness of the natural processes that evolve molecules and functions - so that things doing similar functions can descend from very different origins depending on  itself but also of the state



## Effectors are secreted out of the pathogen and into the host

A great place to start thinking about what makes an effector is to consider the way that the pathogen interacts with the host and one killer thing we know is that the effectors have to get out of the pathogen and into the host, across membranes and even get transported across the host cell. So we can look at protein features like secretion signals and build up libraries based on what we already know about those.

We can also take model sets of proteins that we already know to be effectors and use those as a template to find new ones in other species.

## Our objective
This will be the focus of this session - how to go from sequence identified in a genomics project to a short-list of candidates based on certain characteristics using Galaxy tools and software.
