title: Finding Effector Genes and Proteins in DNA Sequence
---

In this lesson we will look at some of the varied techniques for finding a particular type of gene in some DNA sequence.  

>## Prerequisites {.prereq}
> For this course you are going to need to know a very small amount of basic effector biology (you'll learn a lot more from real experts later in the Summer School) the link here on bacterial effectors should do as suitable background reading for this lesson.
>
> [Bacterial effectors on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_effector_protein)
>
> All sorts of microbes secrete effectors, not just bacteria.



> ## Getting ready {.getready}
> Again you just need to log into the TSL Galaxy Server at [http://galaxy.tsl.ac.uk](http://galaxy.tsl.ac.uk)
