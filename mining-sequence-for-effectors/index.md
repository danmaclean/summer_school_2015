title: Finding Effector Genes in DNA Sequence
---

In this lesson we will look at some of the varied techniques for finding a particular type of gene in some DNA sequence.  

>## Prerequisites {.prereq}
> For this course you are going to need to know a very small amount of basic effector biology (you'll learn a lot more from real experts later in the Summer School) the link here on bacterial effectors should do as suitable background reading for this lesson.
> 
> [Bacterial effectors on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_effector_protein)
> 
> All sorts of microbes secrete effectors, not just bacteria.

In this lesson we don't have the scope or chemicals to do the mutation bit, so we'll pick up with the genomics and use Galaxy and Galaxy tools to carry out the analysis that takes us from sequence data to actual candidate mutations in the genome sequence.

This lesson will use a _virtual machine_ (a small computer-within-a-computer) system to get you a working install of Galaxy and all the data that we need for the lesson. 

> ## Getting ready {.getready}
> Again you just need to log into the TSL Galaxy Server at [http://galaxy.tsl.ac.uk](http://galaxy.tsl.ac.uk)
