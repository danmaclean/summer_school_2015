[Fastq](reference.html#Fastq) is a typical sequence format generated by HTS machines. It contains four lines, a sequence ID, the sequence, the ID again and a messy looking quality string made up of characters, each of which represents the quality of the base above it. Here's an example:

~~~ {.output}
 @SEQ_ID
 GATTTGGGGTTCAAAGCAGTATCGATCAAATAGTAAATCCATTTGTTCAACTCACAGTTT
 +SEQ_ID
 !''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*''))**55CCF>>>>>>CCCCCCC65
~~~

Each of the weird characters represents a number according to the [`ASCII`](reference.html#ASCII) look up table, where numbers are linked to characters, so `!` means `33` and `"` means 34. These numbers are generally [`Phred`](reference.html#Phred) scores, which encode the likelihood of the base being wrong on a log scale.

We can use this quality information to assess how well our sequencing went. Along with sequence quality information we should also assess the composition of the sequence data. A program called [`FastQC`](reference.html#FastQC) is useful for this.

FastQC presents a range of plots and summary statistics, you need to provide it with Fastq data.

A typical output is like this:

![FastQC Summary Plot](img/fastqc.png)

This is the `per base sequence quality`. The plot shows along the x-axis the position in the read and for each position in the reads it shows a box-plot of all the quality scores at that position. 

Noticeably in this figure, the box plots to the left have much higher and tightly grouped quality scores than those on the right. This is typical of Illumina machine sequence, the quality decreases the further you get along the read. As you can infer from the red region of the plot background, Phred scores less than 20 are generally not trusted.

> ## Quality score encoding {.callout}
> Different sequencers use slightly different variations on the Phred score, this is usually called the [quality encoding](reference.html#encoding). Older Illumina pipelines encoded a score from -5 to 62 using ASCII characters 59 to 126, but nowadays most use Sanger encoding, which encodes a score from 0 to 93 using ASCII 33 to 126.

We may (or may not) decide that we need to get rid of the lower quality sequence. 

At the individual sequence read level, we can discard entire sequences if part is too poor or trim the read leaving the good part alone. One system for doing this is [Trimmomatic](reference.html#trimmomatic) which can perform a variety of trimming operations on sequence reads.  It can remove parts of reads from the left or right sides up to quality thresholds - it uses a sliding window average, rather than just a harsh cut-off. 

> ## Sometimes we shouldn't trim {.callout}
> If we do carry out trimming, then we may end up with lots of reads of different lengths - this can be a problem for some aligners and downstream tools, so sometimes trimming isn't the best strategy, we have to make context dependent decisions.

At the sequence sample level (e.g, the read file level), we may discover that our read set is not good. Reports from FastQC like the [`kmer`](reference.html#kmer) content plot can show sequence problems, in this graph there is an over-representation of particular kmers at the start of the sequence that shouldn't be there.

![The first few bases here are significantly enriched, this can be due to sequence adapters (if they were used) but if not, then the sequence is likely not good, even if the quality scores are fine](img/kmer_content.png)

> ## Your task now is to load up Galaxy and run some reads through quality control and trimming, prior to downstream use. {.callout}
  
> ## Power Up The VM {.callout}
>	1. Start  `VirtualBox` by double-clicking it's application icon.
>	2. Use `File` .. `Import Appliance` and select the `GCC2015-CandiSNP.ova` VM file.
>	3. Wait until it finishes importing and press the green `start` button
>	4. Login. The password is `12345`


> ## Connecting to the internet {.callout}
> You may need to change the VirtualBox network adapter if you get a report like:
>
>~~~ {.error}
>
> en3 network adapter not found
>
>~~~
>
> Try using VirtualBox's other network settings under `Devices` .. `Network` .. `Network Settings..`. Usually you should select, `NAT`. You can tell whether it's working by using the web browser within the machine and navigating to an external site e.g [http://bbc.co.uk](http://bbc.co.uk)

>## Starting Galaxy {.callout}
> You can either:
>
>	1. Double click the `Launch Galaxy` icon on the Desktop. You'll need to be patient, Galaxy takes a little while to launch. 
>   (it should take about a minute to launch, so don't panic if it doesn't ping into life immediately)
>	Or
>	
>	2. Start a terminal `cd /var/git/galaxy`, `sh run.sh`, navigate to `localhost:8080` with the web browser.
>

> ##1. Run FastQC {.challenge}
> Use the reads in the `QC` `Shared Data` library. You will find the `FastQC` tool in the tool list under `HTS QC`.
> The reads are single ended from a mutagenised _Arabidopsis thaliana_ (a model plant). They are Illumina [Whole Genome Shotgun reads](reference.html#whole_genome_shotgun) so don't have any multiplex adapters and the plants are grown in sterile culture so we aren't expecting contamination.
>
> 1. How many reads are you using?
> 2. What sort of output files do you get from FastQC?
> 3. What should you do with these files? Do they represent a scientific control that could be published?
>

> ##2. Interpret Sequence Quality {.challenge}
>
> 1. Is there any evidence of contamination? Which report tells you?
> 2. If there is, which sequence is contaminating?
> 3. Which of the four files is the best?
> 

> ##3. Clean Up Poor Quality Sequence {.challenge}
> Use the `Trimmomatic` tool in `HTS QC`. Select an appropriate `Average quality required`
> 
> 1. Find a trimming strategy to get rid of contamination you observed in section `2.1`?
> 2. Which trimming strategy improves the low quality reads
> 3. Did it make any difference?
> 4. How could you filter on size? If you needed to pass only good quality, full length sequences to the next step?
