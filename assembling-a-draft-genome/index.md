title: Assembling a draft genome in the Galaxy Interface
---

In this lesson we will look at the powerful Galaxy Workflow Environment in which we will run an assembly of some High Throughput Illumina reads.

In this lesson we don't have the scope or time to do an assembly of a whole genome - the algorithms take quite a while to run, so we'll do a toy example that will at least complete in time. 

We'll look at what it takes to work out running an assembly and doing the proper quality control to make sure that it is of good quality once it is done.
